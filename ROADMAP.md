# UAICP Reference Implementation Roadmap

## Current

- identity and attestation validation
- policy evaluation baseline

## Next

- invariant evaluation engine
- verification report assembly
- audit event envelope helpers

## Later

- adapter helper packages
- conformance harness runner

## Exit Criteria

`Next` is complete when:

- baseline invariant evaluator can gate `deliver` state decisions
- verification report output is schema-compatible
- audit helper emits required trace fields for replay

## Tracking

Roadmap coordination lives in the specification repository:
