# UAICP Reference Implementation

## Archived Repository

This repository is archived and read-only.

The canonical source has moved to the UAICP monorepo:
- [UAICP/uaicp](https://github.com/UAICP/uaicp)
- [reference-impl/](https://github.com/UAICP/uaicp/tree/main/reference-impl)

Reference implementation primitives for the UAICP reliability contract.

UAICP is an open-source contribution initiated by **Prismworks AI** ([prismworks.ai](https://prismworks.ai)) and developed with community contributions.

## Purpose

This repository provides concrete, composable building blocks and examples for enforcing UAICP controls under existing orchestration frameworks.

Protocol source of truth:

- [specification/](https://github.com/UAICP/uaicp/tree/main/specification)

## Implemented Modules

- `src/identity`
  - schema contracts for identity and attestation
  - validator with strict/optional attestation modes
- `src/policy`
  - deterministic policy evaluator for `allow`, `deny`, `needs_review`
  - reason-coded decisions for runtime gating
- `src/examples/finance/workflow-comparison.ts`
  - side-by-side finance workflow comparison:
    - `manual`
    - `agentic`
    - `agent_without_uaicp`
    - `agent_with_uaicp`

## Finance Workflow Comparison

The included finance scenario models a high-risk write action (`reverse_wire_transfer`) and shows behavioral differences across implementation styles.

What it demonstrates:

- where unsafe approvals can happen without deterministic gates
- how explicit approval and evidence requirements change outcomes
- how UAICP identity/policy/evidence/verification gates control final delivery

Run it:

```bash
npm install
npm run example:finance
```

Run tests:

```bash
npm test
npm run build
```
